## Java EE Application on Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes, or k8s in short, is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It manages containerized applications across multiple hosts and provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

It allows the user to provide declarative primitives for the desired state, for example “need 5 WildFly servers and 1 MySQL server running”. Kubernetes self-healing mechanisms, such as auto-restarting, re-scheduling, and replicating containers then ensure this state is met. The user just define the state and Kubernetes ensures that the state is met at all times on the cluster.

*How is it related to Docker?*

Docker provides the lifecycle management of containers. A Docker image defines a build time representation of the runtime containers. There are commands to start, stop, restart, link, and perform other lifecycle methods on these containers. Kubernetes uses Docker to package, instantiate, and run containerized applications.

*How does Kubernetes simplify containerized application deployment?*

A typical application would have a cluster of containers across multiple hosts. For example, your web tier (for example Undertow) might run on a set of containers. Similarly, your application tier (for example, WildFly) would run on a different set of containers. The web tier would need to delegate the request to application tier. In some cases, or at least to begin with, you may have your web and application server packaged together in the same set of containers. The database tier would generally run on a separate tier anyway. These containers would need to talk to each other. Using any of the solutions mentioned above would require scripting to start the containers, and monitoring/bouncing if something goes down. Kubernetes does all of that for the user after the application state has been defined.

### Key Concepts

At a very high level, there are three key concepts:

. *Pods* are the smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed. Its a logical collection of containers that belong to an application.
. *Master* is the central control point that provides a unified view of the cluster. There is a single master node that control multiple minions.
. *Minion* is a worker node that run tasks as delegated by the master. Minions can run one or more pods. It provides an application-specific “virtual host” in a containerized environment.

A picture is always worth a thousand words and so this is a high-level logical block diagram for Kubernetes:

After the 50,000 feet view, lets fly a little lower at 30,000 feet and take a look at how Kubernetes make all of this happen. There are a few key components at Master and Minion that make this happen.

. *Replication Controller* is a resource at Master that ensures that requested number of pods are running on minions at all times.
. *Service* is an object on master that provides load balancing across a replicated group of pods.
Label is an arbitrary key/value pair in a distributed watchable storage that the Replication Controller uses for service discovery.
. *Kubelet* Each minion runs services to run containers and be managed from the master. In addition to Docker, Kubelet is another key service installed there. It reads container manifests as YAML files that describes a pod. Kubelet ensures that the containers defined in the pods are started and continue running.
. Master serves *RESTful Kubernetes API* that validate and configure Pod, Service, and Replication Controller.

### Start Kubernetes Cluster

. Download Kubernetes from http://<INSTRUCTOR_IP>:8082/kubernetes.tar.gz (version 0.18.2)
. Setup a cluster as:
+
[source, text]
----
cd kubernetes

export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=vagrant
./cluster/kube-up.sh
----
+
The KUBERNETES_PROVIDER environment variable tells all of the various cluster management scripts which variant to use.
+
Vagrant will provision each machine in the cluster with all the necessary components to run Kubernetes. The initial setup can take a few minutes to complete on each machine.
+
This will take a few minutes and shows the output as:
+
[source, text]
----
Starting cluster using provider: vagrant
... calling verify-prereqs
... calling kube-up
Using credentials: vagrant:vagrant

. . .

Cluster validation succeeded
Done, listing cluster services:

Kubernetes master is running at https://10.245.1.2
KubeDNS is running at https://10.245.1.2/api/v1beta3/proxy/namespaces/default/services/kube-dns
----
+
Note down the address for Kubernetes master, `https://10.245.1.2` in this case.
+
. Verify the Kubernetes cluster as:
+
[source, text]
----
kubernetes> vagrant status
Current machine states:

master                    running (virtualbox)
minion-1                  running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
----
+
By default, the Vagrant setup will create a single kubernetes-master and 1 kubernetes-minion. Each VM will take 1 GB, so make sure you have at least 2GB to 4GB of free memory (plus appropriate free disk space).
+
NOTE: By default, only one minion is created. This can be manipulated by setting an environment variable NUM_MINIONS variable to an integer before invoking `kube-up.sh` script.
+
By default, each VM in the cluster is running Fedora, and all of the Kubernetes services are installed into systemd.

By default, five pods are running:

. `etcd-server-kubernetes-master`
. `kube-apiserver-kubernetes-master`
. `kube-controller-manager-kubernetes-master`
. `kube-dns-v1-qfe73`
. `kube-scheduler-kubernetes-master`

Three interesting containers running in `kube-dns-v1-qfe73` pod are:

. *skydns*: SkyDNS is a distributed service for announcement and discovery of services built on top of etcd. It utilizes DNS queries to discover available services.
. *etcd*: A distributed, consistent key value store for shared configuration and service discovery with a focus on being simple, secure, fast, reliable. This is used for storing state information for Kubernetes.
. *kube2sky*: A bridge between Kubernetes and SkyDNS. This will watch the kubernetes API for changes in Services and then publish those changes to SkyDNS through etcd.

#### Kubernetes Master
