## Deploy Application on Kubernetes Cluster

[quote, github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/]
Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes, or "`k8s`" in short, allows the user to provide declarative primitives for the desired state, for example "`need 5 WildFly servers and 1 MySQL server running`". Kubernetes self-healing mechanisms, such as auto-restarting, re-scheduling, and replicating containers then ensure that this state is met. The user just define the state and Kubernetes ensures that the state is met at all times on the cluster.

*How is it related to Docker?*

Docker provides the lifecycle management of containers. A Docker image defines a build time representation of the runtime containers. There are commands to start, stop, restart, link, and perform other lifecycle methods on these containers. Kubernetes uses Docker to package, instantiate, and run containerized applications.

*How does Kubernetes simplify containerized application deployment?*

A typical application would have a cluster of containers across multiple hosts. For example, your web tier (for example Apache) might run as a few instances, and likely on a set of containers. Similarly, your application tier (for example, WildFly) would run on a different set of containers. The web tier would need to delegate the request to application tier. The web, application, and database tier would generally run on a separate set of containers. These containers would need to talk to each other. Using any of the solutions mentioned above would require scripting to start the containers, and monitoring/bouncing if something goes down. Kubernetes does all of that for the user after the application state has been defined.

### Key Components

At a very high level, there are three key components:

. *Pods* are the smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed. Its a logical collection of containers that belong to an application.
. *Master* is the central control point that provides a unified view of the cluster. There is a single master node that control multiple worker nodes.
. *Node* (n√©e minion) is a worker node that run tasks as delegated by the master. Nodes can run one or more pods. It provides an application-specific "`virtual host`" in a containerized environment.

A picture is always worth a thousand words and so this is a high-level logical block diagram for Kubernetes:

.Kubernetes Key Components

After the 50,000 feet view, lets fly a little lower at 30,000 feet and take a look at how Kubernetes make all of this happen. There are a few key components at Master and Node that make this happen.

. *Replication Controller* is a resource at Master that ensures that requested number of pods are running on nodes at all times.
. *Service* is an object on master that provides load balancing across a replicated group of pods.
Label is an arbitrary key/value pair in a distributed watchable storage that the Replication Controller uses for service discovery.
. *Kubelet* Each node runs services to run containers and be managed from the master. In addition to Docker, Kubelet is another key service installed there. It reads container manifests as YAML files that describes a pod. Kubelet ensures that the containers defined in the pods are started and continue running.
. Master serves *RESTful Kubernetes API* that validate and configure Pod, Service, and Replication Controller.

### Start Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes cluster can be easily started using Vagrant. Start a Kubernetes cluster as explained in <<Kubernetes_Setup>>.

#### Verify the Cluster

. Verify the Kubernetes cluster as:
+
[source, text]
----
vagrant status
Current machine states:

master                    running (virtualbox)
minion-1                  running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
----
+
By default, the Vagrant setup will create a single Master and one node. Each VM will take 1 GB, so make sure you have at least 2GB to 4GB of free memory (plus appropriate free disk space).
+
NOTE: By default, only one node is created. This can be manipulated by setting an environment variable NUM_MINIONS variable to an integer before invoking `kube-up.sh` script.
+
.Kubernetes Cluster using Vagrant
image::kubernetes-cluster-vagrant.png[]
+
By default, each VM in the cluster is running Fedora, Kubelet is installed into ``systemd'', and all other Kubernetes services are running as containers on Master.
+
. Access https://10.245.1.2 (or whatever IP address is assigned to your kubernetes cluster start up log). This may present the warning as shown below:
+
image::kubernetes-master-default-output-certificate.png[]

[[Deploy_JavaEE_Kubernetes_Multiple_Config]]
### Deploy Java EE Application (multiple configuration files)

Pods, and the IP addresses assigned to them, are ephemeral. If a pod dies then Kubernetes will recreate that pod because of its self-healing features, but it might recreate it on a different host. Even if it is on the same host, a different IP address could be assigned to it. And so any application cannot rely upon the IP address of the pod.

Kubernetes services is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods. A service is typically back-ended by one or more physical pods (associated using labels), and it has a permanent IP address that can be used by other pods/applications. For example, WildFly pod can not directly connect to a Couchbase pod but can connect to Couchbase service. In essence, Kubernetes service offers clients an IP and port pair which, when accessed, redirects to the appropriate backends.

.Kubernetes Service
image::kubernetes-service.png[]

NOTE: In this case, all the pods are running on a single node. This is because, that is the default number for a Kubernetes cluster. The pod can be on another node if more number of nodes are configured to start in the cluster.

Any Service that a Pod wants to access must be created before the Pod itself, or else the environment variables will not be populated.

The order of Service and the targeted Pods does not matter. However Service needs to be started before any other Pods consuming the Service are started.

#### Start Couchbase Pod

. Start Couchbase Pod:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ~/workspaces/docker-java/attendees/kubernetes/app-couchbase-pod.yaml
pod "couchbase-pod" created
----
+
It uses the following configuration file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: couchbase-pod
  labels:
    name: couchbase-pod
    context: docker-k8s-lab
spec:
  containers: 
    - 
      name: couchbase
      image: arungupta/couchbase
      ports: 
        - 
          containerPort: 8091
          containerPort: 8092
          containerPort: 8093
          containerPort: 11210
----
+
`arungupta/couchbase` image starts Couchbase server, configures it using http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.0/rest-api/rest-endpoints-all.html[Couchbase REST API], and loads a sample data bucket.
+
. Get status of the Pod:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get -w po
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
couchbase-pod   0/1       Pending   0          16s
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
couchbase-pod   0/1       Running   0          40s
couchbase-pod   1/1       Running   0         40s
----
+
`-w` watches for changes to the requested object. Wait for the Couchbase pod to be in Running status.
+
Hit `Ctrl` + `C` to terminate the watch.

#### Start Couchbase service

. Start Couchbase Service:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ~/workspaces/docker-java/attendees/kubernetes/app-couchbase-service.yaml
service "couchbase-service" created
----
+
It uses the following configuration file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: 
  name: couchbase-service
  labels: 
    name: couchbase-pod
    context: docker-k8s-lab
spec: 
  ports:
    # the port that this service should serve on
    - name: admin
      port: 8091
    - name: queries
      port: 8092
    - name: rest
      port: 8093
    - name: nodes
      port: 11210
  # label keys and values that must match in order to receive traffic for this service
  selector: 
    name: couchbase-pod
    context: docker-k8s-lab
----
+
Once again, the label "`context: docker-k8s-lab`" is used. This simplifies querying the created pods later on.
+
. Get status of the Service:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get svc 
NAME                CLUSTER_IP      EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)                                SELECTOR                                    AGE
couchbase-service   10.247.202.53   <none>        8091/TCP,8092/TCP,8093/TCP,11210/TCP   context=docker-k8s-lab,name=couchbase-pod   1m
kubernetes          10.247.0.1      <none>        443/TCP                                <none>                                      32m
----
+
If multiple services are running, then it can be narrowed by specifying the labels:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get svc -l context=docker-k8s-lab,name=couchbase-pod
NAME                CLUSTER_IP      EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)                                SELECTOR                                    AGE
couchbase-service   10.247.202.53   <none>        8091/TCP,8092/TCP,8093/TCP,11210/TCP   context=docker-k8s-lab,name=couchbase-pod   1m
----
+
This is also the selector label used by Service to target Pods.
+
When a Service is run on a node, the kubelet adds a set of environment variables for each active Service. It supports both Docker links compatible variables and simpler `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_HOST` and `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_PORT` variables, where the Service name is upper-cased and dashes are converted to underscores.
+
Our service name is "`couchbase-service`" and so `COUCHBASE_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST` and `COUCHBASE_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT` variables are available to other pods.

Kubernetes also allows services to be resolved using DNS configuration. Send a Pull Request for adding this functionality to the lab as explained in https://github.com/javaee-samples/docker-java/issues/62[#62].

### Deploy Java EE Application (one configuration file)

Kubernetes allow multiple resources to be specified in a single configuration file. This allows to create a "`Kubernetes Application`" that can consists of multiple resources easily.

<<Deploy_JavaEE_Kubernetes_Multiple_Config>> showed how to deploy the Java EE application using multiple configuration files. This application can be delpoyed using a single configuration file as well.

. First delete the the existing pods and replication controller using the context label:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh delete svc,po,replicationController -l context="docker-k8s-lab"
service "mysql-service" deleted
pod "mysql-pod" deleted
replicationcontroller "wildfly-rc" deleted
----
+
. Start the application using the configuration file:
+
[source, yaml]
....
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:

....
+
Notice that each section, one each for MySQL Pod, MySQL Service, and WildFly Replication Controller, is separated by `----`.
+
. Start the application:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ~/workspaces/docker-java/attendees/kubernetes/app.yaml
pod "mysql-pod" created
service "mysql-service" created
replicationcontroller "wildfly-rc" created
----
+
. Access the application using <<Access_Kubernetes_Application_Node>> or <<Access_Kubernetes_Application_Proxy>>.

### Rescheduling Pods

Replication Controller ensures that specified number of pod "`replicas`" are running at any one time. If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.

WildFly Replication Controller is already running with one Pod. Lets delete this Pod and see how a new Pod is automatically rescheduled.

. Find the Pod's name:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get po
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-pod          1/1       Running   0          21s
wildfly-rc-l2cto   1/1       Running   0          21s
----
+
. Delete the Pod:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh delete po wildfly-rc-l2cto
pod "wildfly-rc-l2cto" deleted
----
+
Status of the Pods can be seen:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get -w po
NAME               READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-pod          1/1       Running       0          1m
wildfly-rc-2o8vd   1/1       Running       0          13s
wildfly-rc-l2cto   1/1       Terminating   0          1m
----
+
Notice how Pod with name "`wildfly-rc-l2cto`" was deleted and a new Pod with the name "`wildfly-rc-2o8vd`" was created. The status "`Terminating`" does not update correctly and is filed as https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/17612.

### Scaling Pods

Replication Controller allows dynamic scaling up and down of Pods.

. Scale up the number of Pods:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh scale --replicas=2 rc wildfly-rc
replicationcontroller "wildfly-rc" scaled
----
+
. Status of the Pods can be seen in another shell:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get -w po
TBD
----
+
Pods are not scaled correctly as explained at https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/17613.
+
TBD: Notice a new Pod with the name "`wildfly-rc-bymu7`" is created.
+
. Scale down the number of Pods:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh scale --replicas=1 rc wildfly-rc
scaled
----
+
. Status of the Pods using `-w` is not shown correctly https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/11338[#11338]. But status of the Pods can be seen correctly as:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get po
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
wildfly-rc-bgtkg   1/1       Running   0          9m
----
+
Notice only one Pod is running now.

### Couchbase Cluster and Persistent Volumes 

A _Kubernetes Volume_ outlives any containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. However the volume will cease to exist when a Pod ceases to exist. This is solved by _Persistent Volumes_ that provide persistent, cluster-scoped storage for applications that require long lived data.

Creating and using a persistent volume is a three step process:

. Administrator provision a _networked storage in the cluster_. This is called as `PersistentVolume`.
. User requests storage for pods by using _claims_. Claims can specify levels of resources (CPU and memory), specific sizes and access modes (e.g. can be mounted once read/write or many times write only). This is called as `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
. Claims are mounted as volumes and used in pods for storage.

#### Create Kubernetes resources

. Create persistent volume:
+
```console
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ~/workspaces/docker-java/attendees/kubernetes/couchbase-pv.yaml 
persistentvolume "pv001" created
```
+
. Create a claim for volume:
+
```console
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ~/workspaces/docker-java/attendees/kubernetes/couchbase-pvc.yaml 
persistentvolumeclaim "pvc001" created
```
+
. Start the Couchbase Replication Controller (claim is used in Pod's definition):
+
```console
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ~/workspaces/docker-java/attendees/kubernetes/couchbase-rc.yaml
replicationcontroller "couchbase-rc" created
```
+
Check status of Replication Controller:
+
```console
./cluster/kubectl.sh get -w po
NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
couchbase-rc-s5o22   0/1       Pending   0          9s
NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
couchbase-rc-s5o22   0/1       Running   0          47s
couchbase-rc-s5o22   1/1       Running   0         47s
```
+
. Start Couchbase Service:
+
```console
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ~/workspaces/docker-java/attendees/kubernetes/couchbase-service.yaml 
service "couchbase-service" created
```

#### Initialize Couchbase Cluster

. Set data and index memory quota for Couchbase:
+
```console
./cluster/kubectl.sh exec couchbase-rc-s5o22 -- curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8091/pools/default -d memoryQuota=300 -d indexMemoryQuota=300
```
+
. Configure Data and Query service on Couchbase server:
+
```console
./cluster/kubectl.sh exec couchbase-rc-s5o22 -- /opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli cluster-init -u Administrator -p password -c localhost:8091 --cluster-ramsize=256 --cluster-index-ramsize=256 --services=index,data,query
SUCCESS: init/edit localhost
```
+
. Install travel-sample bucket:
+
```console
./cluster/kubectl.sh exec couchbase-rc-s5o22 -- curl -v -u Administrator:password -X POST http://localhost:8091/sampleBuckets/install -d '["travel-sample"]'
*   Trying ::1...
