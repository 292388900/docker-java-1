## Java EE Application on Kubernetes Cluster

[quote, github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/]
Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes, or ``k8s'' in short, allows the user to provide declarative primitives for the desired state, for example “need 5 WildFly servers and 1 MySQL server running”. Kubernetes self-healing mechanisms, such as auto-restarting, re-scheduling, and replicating containers then ensure this state is met. The user just define the state and Kubernetes ensures that the state is met at all times on the cluster.

*How is it related to Docker?*

Docker provides the lifecycle management of containers. A Docker image defines a build time representation of the runtime containers. There are commands to start, stop, restart, link, and perform other lifecycle methods on these containers. Kubernetes uses Docker to package, instantiate, and run containerized applications.

*How does Kubernetes simplify containerized application deployment?*

A typical application would have a cluster of containers across multiple hosts. For example, your web tier (for example Undertow) might run as a few instances, and likely on a set of containers. Similarly, your application tier (for example, WildFly) would run on a different set of containers. The web tier would need to delegate the request to application tier. The web, application, and database tier would generally run on a separate set of containers. These containers would need to talk to each other. Using any of the solutions mentioned above would require scripting to start the containers, and monitoring/bouncing if something goes down. Kubernetes does all of that for the user after the application state has been defined.

### Key Components

At a very high level, there are three key components:

. *Pods* are the smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed. Its a logical collection of containers that belong to an application.
. *Master* is the central control point that provides a unified view of the cluster. There is a single master node that control multiple minions.
. *Node* is a worker node that run tasks as delegated by the master. Minions can run one or more pods. It provides an application-specific “virtual host” in a containerized environment.

A picture is always worth a thousand words and so this is a high-level logical block diagram for Kubernetes:

After the 50,000 feet view, lets fly a little lower at 30,000 feet and take a look at how Kubernetes make all of this happen. There are a few key components at Master and Minion that make this happen.

. *Replication Controller* is a resource at Master that ensures that requested number of pods are running on minions at all times.
. *Service* is an object on master that provides load balancing across a replicated group of pods.
Label is an arbitrary key/value pair in a distributed watchable storage that the Replication Controller uses for service discovery.
. *Kubelet* Each minion runs services to run containers and be managed from the master. In addition to Docker, Kubelet is another key service installed there. It reads container manifests as YAML files that describes a pod. Kubelet ensures that the containers defined in the pods are started and continue running.
. Master serves *RESTful Kubernetes API* that validate and configure Pod, Service, and Replication Controller.

### Start Kubernetes Cluster

. In ``kubernetes'' directory, setup a cluster as:
+
[source, text]
----
cd kubernetes

export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=vagrant
./cluster/kube-up.sh
----
+
The `KUBERNETES_PROVIDER` environment variable tells all of the various cluster management scripts which variant to use.
+
NOTE: This will take a few minutes, so be patience! Vagrant will provision each machine in the cluster with all the necessary components to run Kubernetes.
+
It shows the output as:
+
[source, text]
----
Starting cluster using provider: vagrant
... calling verify-prereqs
... calling kube-up
Using credentials: vagrant:vagrant

. . .

Cluster validation succeeded
Done, listing cluster services:

Kubernetes master is running at https://10.245.1.2
KubeDNS is running at https://10.245.1.2/api/v1beta3/proxy/namespaces/default/services/kube-dns
----
+
Note down the address for Kubernetes master, `https://10.245.1.2` in this case.
+
. Verify the Kubernetes cluster as:
+
[source, text]
----
kubernetes> vagrant status
Current machine states:

master                    running (virtualbox)
minion-1                  running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
----
+
By default, the Vagrant setup will create a single kubernetes-master and 1 kubernetes-minion. Each VM will take 1 GB, so make sure you have at least 2GB to 4GB of free memory (plus appropriate free disk space).
+
NOTE: By default, only one minion is created. This can be manipulated by setting an environment variable NUM_MINIONS variable to an integer before invoking `kube-up.sh` script.
+
By default, each VM in the cluster is running Fedora, Kubelet is installed into ``systemd'', and all other Kubernetes services are running as containers on Master.
+
. Access https://10.245.1.2 (or whatever IP address is assigned to your kubernetes cluster start up log). This may present the warning as shown below:
+
image::../images/kubernetes-master-default-output-certificate.png[]
+
Click on ``Advanced'' and then on ``Proceed to 10.245.1.2'' to see the output as:
+
.Kubernetes Output from Master
image::../images/kubernetes-master-default-output.png[]
+
Use ``vagrant'' as the username and ``vagrant'' as the password.
+
Check the list of nodes as:

### Deploy Java EE Application

Pods, and the IP addresses assigned to them, are ephemeral. If a pod dies then Kubernetes will recreate that pod because of its self-healing features, but it might recreate it on a different host. Even if it is on the same host, a different IP address could be assigned to it. And so any application cannot rely upon the IP address of the pod.

Kubernetes services is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods. A service is typically back-ended by one or more physical pods (associated using labels), and it has a permanent IP address that can be used by other pods/applications. For example, WildFly pod can not directly connect to a MySQL pod but can connect to MySQL service. In essence, Kubernetes service offers clients an IP and port pair which, when accessed, redirects to the appropriate backends.

.Kubernetes Services
image::../images/kubernetes-services.png[]

NOTE: In this case, all the pods are running on a single minion. This is because, that is the default number for a Kubernetes cluster. The pod can very be on another minion if more minions exist in the cluster.

Any Service that a Pod wants to access must be created before the Pod itself, or else the environment variables will not be populated.

#### Start MySQL Service

. Start MySQL service as:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ../../attendees/kubernetes/mysql-service.yaml
----
+
It uses the following configuration file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
id: mysql
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1beta3
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    name: mysql
    context: docker-k8s-lab
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3306
  selector:
    name: mysql
  labels:
    name: mysql
----
+
. Check that the service is created:
+
[source, text]
----
> ./cluster/kubectl.sh get se -l context=docker-k8s-lab
NAME      LABELS                              SELECTOR     IP(S)            PORT(S)
mysql     context=docker-k8s-lab,name=mysql   name=mysql   10.247.141.208   3306/TCP
----
+
Note that the label used during the creation is used to query the service.
+
When a Pod is run on a node, the kubelet adds a set of environment variables for each active Service. 
+
It supports both Docker links compatible variables and simpler `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_HOST` and `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_PORT` variables, where the Service name is upper-cased and dashes are converted to underscores.
+
Our service name is ``mysql'' and so `MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST` and `MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT` variables are available to other pods.
