## Verify Docker Configuration

Check if your Docker Host is running:

[source, text]
----
docker-machine ls
----

You should see the output similar to:

[source, text]
----
NAME        ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM
lab                  virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.101:2376   
----

If the machine state is stopped, start it with:

[source, text]
----
docker-machine start lab
----

After it is started you can find out IP address of your host with:

[source, text]
----
docker-machine ip lab
----

We already did this during the setup document, remember? So, this is a good chance to check, if you already added this IP to your hosts file.

Type:

[source, text]
----
ping dockerhost
----

and see if this resolves to the IP address that the docker-machine command printed out. You should see an output as:

[source, text]
----
> ping dockerhost
PING dockerhost (192.168.99.101): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.99.101: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.394 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.99.101: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.387 ms
----

If it does, you're ready to start over with the lab. If it does not, make sure you've followed the steps to https://github.com/arun-gupta/docker-java/tree/master/attendees#configure-host[configure your host].
