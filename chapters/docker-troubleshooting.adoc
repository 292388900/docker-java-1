== Troubleshooting

=== Loading Images Offline

Depending upon the network speed and restrictions, you may not be able to download Docker images from Docker Hub. The error message may look like:

[source, text]
----
$ docker pull arungupta/wildfly-mysql-javaee7
Using default tag: latest
Pulling repository docker.io/arungupta/wildfly-mysql-javaee7
Network timed out while trying to connect to https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/arungupta/wildfly-mysql-javaee7/images. You may want to check your internet connection or if you are behind a proxy.
----

If you are not able to download images from Docker Hub, then they can uploaded from a previously saved `.tar` file.

Save the tar file:

[source, text]
----
docker save -o <save image to path> <image name>
----

For example:

[source, text]
----
docker save -o arungupta-javaee7-hol.tar arungupta/javaee7-hol
----

All images required for this workshop can be downloaded from:

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8g4lYJ4uB37RkdqbFpPZU5ZS2s&usp=sharing

Load the tar file:

[source, text]
----
docker load -i <path to image tar file>
----

For example:

[source, text]
----
docker load -i arungupta-javaee7-hol.tar
----

Now `docker images` should show the image.
