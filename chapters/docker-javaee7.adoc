Pull the Docker image that contains WildFly and pre-built Java EE 7 application WAR file as shown:

[source, text]
----
docker pull <INSTRUCTOR_IP>:5000/javaee7-hol
----

The javaee7-hol link:https://github.com/arun-gupta/docker-images/blob/master/javaee7-hol/Dockerfile[Dockerfile] is based on `jboss/wildfly` and adds the movieplex7 application as war file.

Run it as:

[source, text]
----
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 <INSTRUCTOR_IP>:5000/javaee7-hol
----

See the application in action at http://dockerhost:8080/movieplex7/.

Only two changes are required to the standard `jboss/wildfly` image:

. Start WildFly in full platform:
+
[source, text]
----
CMD ["/opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh", "-c", "standalone-full.xml", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
----
+
. WAR file is copied to `standalone/deployments` directory as:
+
[source, text]
----
RUN curl -L https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-hol/blob/jrebel/solution/movieplex7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war?raw=true -o /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/movieplex7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
