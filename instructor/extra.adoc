This are some instructions to keep the instructor environment


## Uptating the attendees instructions served by the instructor httpd server

The instructor webserver [http://localhost:8082/] provides the link:++..\attendees\readme.adoc[attendes instructions] in the HTML format.

To update the HTML have http://asciidoctor.org/ installed and run the following command:

[source, text]

If you need to update the nexusbackup.tar file, run the following command:

[source, text]
----
docker run --rm --volumes-from nexusdata -v  $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/nexusbackup.tar /sonatype-work
