== CI/CD using Jenkins and Docker

All instructions and resources are in  `attendees/cicd` directory.

=== Git

. Start Git server by following link:git-server/README.adoc[].
.. Clone the project https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-docker-maven and push to this git server.

=== Jenkins

. Start Jenkins in `jenkins` directory by giving the command `docker-compose up -d`
. Create a new workflow and use the script:
+
[source, text]
----
node {
  sh "echo hello"
  git url: 'http://192.168.99.101:3000/arun/hello-world.git'
  sh "mvn package -Pdocker"
}
----
+
NOTE: Change the IP address to point to Docker host where the Git server is running. Change name of the project accordingly as well.
+
. Run a build

=== Expected Flow

. `git push` will push changes to Git server
. This will trigger a build in Jenkins (TODO: Configure hook)
. Jenkins workflow will build a Docker image (stuck here)
. Jenkins workflow will push the Docker image to a registry
