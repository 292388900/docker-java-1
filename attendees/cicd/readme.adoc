== Continuous Deployment using Jenkins and Docker

All instructions and resources are in  `attendees/cicd` directory.

NOTE: Change IP address to the Docker host where Git server is running.

=== Git

. Start Git server by following link:git-server/README.adoc[]
. Create a new repository `javaee7-docker-workflow`.
. Add a new Java EE sample that has Arquillian tests and packaged as Docker image:

  git clone https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-docker-workflow.git
  git remote add gogs http://192.168.99.101:3000/arun/javaee7-docker-workflow.git
  git push gogs master

=== Jenkins

. Start Jenkins in `jenkins` directory by giving the command `docker-compose up -d`
. Enable Docker commands in Jenkins `docker-machine ssh default "sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock"`
. Create a new workflow and use "`Workflow script from SCM`". Use the "`Repository URL`" as "`https://github.com/arun-gupta/javaee7-docker-workflow`" and "`Script Path`" as "`Jenkinsfile`".
. Start a build

=== Current Status

. Checks out the application workspace from Gogs server
. Builds the application and runs the test
. Creates a Docker image for the application

=== TODO

. https://github.com/javaee-samples/docker-java/issues/96[Build CI/CD project from git hook/poll]
. https://github.com/javaee-samples/docker-java/issues/95[Push CI/CD Docker images to Docker registry]
. https://github.com/javaee-samples/docker-java/issues/94[Consolidate docker-compose.yml for CI/CD]
