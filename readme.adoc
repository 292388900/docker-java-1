= Docker and Kubernetes for Java Developers
:toc:
:toc-placement!:

## Preface
Containers are enabling developers to package their applications (and underlying dependencies) in new ways that are portable and work consistently everywhere? On your machine, in production, in your data center, and in the cloud. And Docker has become the de facto standard for those portable containers in the cloud.

Docker is the developer-friendly Linux container technology that enables creation of your stack: OS, JVM, app server, app, and all your custom configuration. So with all it offers, how comfortable are you and your team taking Docker from development to production? Are you hearing developers say, “But it works on my machine!” when code breaks in production?

This lab offers developers an intro-level, hands-on session with Docker, from installation, to exploring Docker Hub, to crafting their own images, to adding Java apps and running custom containers. It will also explain how to use Swarm to orchesorchestrate these containers together. This is a BYOL (bring your own laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop and be ready to dig into a tool that promises to be at the forefront of our industry for some time to come.

## The Lab

### Docker Basics
Docker simplifies software delivery by making it easy to build and share images that contain your application’s entire environment, or application operating system.

**What does it mean by application operating system ?**

Your application typically require a specific version of operating system, application server, JDK, database server, may require to tune the configuration files, and similarly multiple other dependencies. The application may need binding to specific ports and certain amount of memory. The components and configuration together required to run your application is what is referred to as application operating system.

You can certainly provide an installation script that will download and install these components. Docker simplifies this process by allowing to create an image that contains your application and infrastructure together, managed as one component. These images are then used to create Docker containers which run on the container virtualization platform, provided by Docker.

**What can a Java Developer use Docker for?**

__Faster delivery of your applications__

Docker helps you with the development lifecycle.
Docker allows you to develop on local containers that contain your applications
and services. It can then integrate into a continuous integration and
deployment workflow.

For example, you write code locally and share the development stack
via Docker with colleagues. When everybody is ready, you push the
code and the stack you all are developing onto a test environment
and execute any required tests.
From the testing environment, you can then push the Docker images
into production and deploy your code.

__Deploying and scaling more easily__

Docker's container-based platform allows for portable workloads.
Docker containers can run on a developer's local host, on physical
or virtual machines in a data center, or in the Cloud.

Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make dynamically
managing workloads easy. You can use Docker to quickly scale up or
tear down applications and services.
Docker is so fast, that scaling can be near real time.

**How is it different from VM?**

Docker is an open source container virtualization platform.

Docker has three main components:

. __Images__ are *build component* of Docker and a read-only template of application operating system.
. __Containers__ are *run component* of Docker, and created from, images.Containers can be run, started, stopped, moved, and deleted.
. Images are stored, shared, and managed in a __registry__, the *distribution component* of Docker. The publically available registry is known as Docker Hub.

In order for these three components to work together, there is *Docker Daemon* that runs on a host machine and does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing Docker containers. In addition, there is *Client* that is a Docker binary which accepts commands from the user and communicates back and forth with the daemon.

.Docker architecture
image::images/docker-architecture.png[]

Client communicates with Daemon, either co-located on the same host, or on a different host. It requests the Daemon to pull an image from the repository using `pull` command. The Daemon then downloads the image from Docker Hub, or whatever registry is configured. Multiple images can be downloaded from the registry and installed on Daemon host. Images are run using `run` command to create containers on demand.

**How does a Docker Image work?**

We've already seen that Docker images are read-only templates from which Docker containers are launched. Each image consists of a series of layers. Docker makes use of union file systems to combine these layers into a single image. Union file systems allow files and directories of separate file systems, known as branches, to be transparently overlaid, forming a single coherent file system.

One of the reasons Docker is so lightweight is because of these layers. When you change a Docker image—for example, update an application to a new version— a new layer gets built. Thus, rather than replacing the whole image or entirely rebuilding, as you may do with a virtual machine, only that layer is added or updated. Now you don't need to distribute a whole new image, just the update, making distributing Docker images faster and simpler.

Every image starts from a base image, for example ubuntu, a base Ubuntu image, or fedora, a base Fedora image. You can also use images of your own as the basis for a new image, for example if you have a base Apache image you could use this as the base of all your web application images.

_Note: Docker usually gets these base images from Docker Hub._

Docker images are then built from these base images using a simple, descriptive set of steps we call instructions. Each instruction creates a new layer in our image. Instructions include actions like:

. Run a command.
. Add a file or directory.
. Create an environment variable.
. What process to run when launching a container from this image.

These instructions are stored in a file called a Dockerfile. Docker reads this Dockerfile when you request a build of an image, executes the instructions, and returns a final image.

**How does a container work?**

A container consists of an operating system, user-added files, and meta-data. As we've seen, each container is built from an image. That image tells Docker what the container holds, what process to run when the container is launched, and a variety of other configuration data. The Docker image is read-only. When Docker runs a container from an image, it adds a read-write layer on top of the image (using a union file system as we saw earlier) in which your application can then run.

### Docker Machine

Machine makes it really easy to create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers and inside your own data center. It creates servers, installs Docker on them, then configures the Docker client to talk to them.

Once your Docker host has been created, it then has a number of commands for managing them:

. Starting, stopping, restarting
. Upgrading Docker
. Configuring the Docker client to talk to your host

You used Docker Machine already during the attendee setup. We won't need it too much further on. But if you need to create hosts, it's a very handy tool to know about. From now on we're mostly going to use the docker client.
Find out more about the details at the link:https://docs.docker.com/machine/[Official Docker Machine Website]

Check if docker machine is working with

[source, text]
----
docker-machine -v
----

### Docker Client
The client communicates with the demon process on your host and let's you work with images and containers.
Check if your client is working with

[source, text]
----
docker -v
----

The most important options you'll be using frequently are:

. `run` - runs a container
. `ps`- lists containers
. `stop` - stops a container

### Ticket Monster
TicketMonster is an example application that focuses on Java EE6 - JPA 2, CDI, EJB 3.1 and JAX-RS along with HTML5 and jQuery Mobile. It is a moderately complex application that demonstrates how to build modern web applications optimized for mobile & desktop. TicketMonster is representative of an online ticketing broker - providing access to events (e.g. concerts, shows, etc) with an online booking application.

Apart from being a demo, TicketMonster provides an already existing application structure that you can use as a starting point for your app. You could try out your use cases, test your own ideas, or, contribute improvements back to the community.

.TicketMonster architecture
image::images/ticket-monster_tutorial_architecture.png[]

The application uses Java EE 6 services to provide business logic and persistence, utilizing technologies such as CDI, EJB 3.1 and JAX-RS, JPA 2. These services back the user-facing booking process, which is implemented using HTML5 and JavaScript, with support for mobile devices through jQuery Mobile.

The administration site is centered around CRUD use cases, so instead of writing everything manually, the business layer and UI are generated by Forge, using EJB 3.1, CDI and JAX-RS. For a better user experience, Twitter Bootstrap is used.

Monitoring sales requires staying in touch with the latest changes on the server side, so this part of the application will be developed in HTML5 and JavaScript using a polling solution.

### Build Ticket Monster
First thing, you're going to do is to build the application from source. Create a folder for the source and change to it
[source, text]
----
mkdir /docker-java/
cd /docker-java/
----
And checkout the sources from the instructor git repository.
[source, text]
----
git clone -b WFLY8.1 http://root:dockeradmin@<INSTRUCTOR_IP>:10080/root/ticket-monster.git
----

From here, you're free to explore the application a bit. Open it with JBDS and find more background about the use-cases and how the application is designed at the link:http://www.jboss.org/ticket-monster/whatisticketmonster/[Ticket Monster Website].

When you're ready, it is time to build the application. Switch to the checkout directory and run maven package.

[source, text]
----
cd /docker-java/ticket-monster
mvn -s settings.xml -f demo/pom.xml package
